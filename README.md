## A Recurrent Reinforcement Learning Strategy with a Parameterized Agent for Online Scheduling of a State Task Network Under Epistemic and Aleatoric Uncertainty

This repository contains the codes used to develop the results from the manuscript _"A Recurrent Reinforcement Learning Strategy with a Parameterized Agent for Online Scheduling of a State Task Network Under Epistemic and Aleatoric Uncertainty"_. The first 8 experiments (i.e., from Exp1 to Exp8) correspond to section 4.1 and the Exp9 and Exp10 to section 4.2. Below, a brief description of the purpose of each experiment is listed.

Exp1: one
Exp2: one
